# CST Tools
The functions are initially drafted in the notebook *CSTtools.ipynb* in the *dev* directory. The functions are copied over to the package.

To use the package it has to be added manually to the current script:

```py
import sys
sys.path.append(r"C:\Users\maxk\Nextcloud\dev\packages")
from csttools.csttools import read_CST_ASCII_format
```
